# Recipe App Monorepo

This repository contains the source code for the Recipe App, which includes:

- A Python backend for recipe generation and API services. Uses LangGraph to run an extraction flow on the specified website.
- An iOS app for user interaction written in native SwiftUI. This was mostly done through a combination of using `gpt-4o` with [aider](https://aider.chat/) and `claude-3.5-sonnet` with Cursor Composer.

Each component is located in its respective subdirectory.
